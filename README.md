# Python---School---Project
We are four 15 year old students with few python expiriences. The project we are working need pygame. Somehow we can't download it. The pc we are using is a Asus fx553vd fhd matt 16:9, it is a Windows 10 Home 64-bit computer. We've tried python 3.0.0, 3.4.1, 3.6.0, 3.6.2, 3.6.4, and 3.7.0. What version should we use, and how do we download pygame?
